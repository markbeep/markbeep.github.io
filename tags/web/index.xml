This is the very first post on here.
This website is mainly to test out new stuff in the direction of web development, as that is a direction I don&amp;rsquo;t currently have a lot of experience with. Additionally, a plan I have in mind is to write quick summaries for topics I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning about. This would be useful for myself to look back at when learning for exams and it might even be interesting for some people to read about the topics.</description></item></channel></rss>
