A fun project I like to work on no matter what language I'm learning is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot. It's a nice way to start working with another big library and also a good way to learn about parsing user inputs. How fleshed out and active the communities are for the different languages all varies widely. Looking at C++, one of the major Discord libraries comes at around 170 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/DiscordPP/discordpp). Most stray away from C++ as it's almost *too* low-level for a Discord bot.
