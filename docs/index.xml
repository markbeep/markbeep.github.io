      <description>The What?&amp;nbsp;¶ A few years ago when I was starting with Python we used to sometimes play little hangman games in class. I thought it to be a really good practice to write a little program, that could tell me what character I should guess next. That&amp;rsquo;s where I started with my hangman solver. I can put in the word I&amp;rsquo;m looking for, the characters that are not allowed and the language (English or German) it should search words for.</description>

      <description>Welcome&amp;nbsp;¶ Welcome to the grand opening of my new website. This is the very first post on here.
This website is mainly to test out new stuff in the direction of web development, as that is a direction I don&amp;rsquo;t currently have a lot of experience with. Additionally, a plan I have in mind is to write quick summaries for topics I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning about. This would be useful for myself to look back at when learning for exams and it might even be interesting for some people to read about the topics.</description>
